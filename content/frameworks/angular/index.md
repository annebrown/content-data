Developed by Google.

Angular's SPA design, loads all necessary code into a single page.  

Its heavy reliance on components as it fundamental building block, allows for independent development, maintenance, and testing, etc, of components.  This makes it easier to break complex tasks into smaller ones, making it more intuitive and enabling intuitive patterns and consistent IF, simplifying code organization and collab.

Content changes are rendered dynamically, loading only that part of the page that needs updating, thus reduces traffic and increasing responsiveness.

Angular's data binding help to build more dynamic interfaces.  

Angular is particularly well-suited for large-scale, enterprise-level apps, due to its ability to handle large, robust, long term, complex projects with high performance and maintainability requirements.

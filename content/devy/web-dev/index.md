## Purpose

To research, analyze (dev experience, libs, etc.) and benchmark comparable, real-world web dev frameworks. 

## Approach

For each Framework being analyzed, create a publicly avail (no auth, no ip-whitelist) web app, with the same data, design, components, structure, and configs, and with comparable tools (parsers, compilers, builder, bundler, etc.) and API calls.  This will focus benchmarking on core framework performance.

## Project Structure

Create an app with the framework's default project structure.  Customize only to achieve similar functionalities or to compare specific features (like SSG).

## Data

Use identical, on-board content.   Access the same public headless CMS, using the same API calls and auth approach (none, unless testing auth).  Use framework core, when , when comparing frameworks.

## Design

Use identical component structures, styling and config.

## Analysis

### Benchmarks

- Server Speeds, including HMR and initial startup, build and render times
- Resource Usage, including CPU and RAM
- Footprint, including bundle sizes

## Developer Experience

Code organization, maintenance, debugging and collab

Also used for capture, storage and access to non-sensitive technology development docs and data.

Uses dynamic frontmatter fields to promote consistency, streamline content maint and reduce human error.

## Design Considerations

Project templates `@/templates` hold the docs (single source of truth) for client app design considerations.
